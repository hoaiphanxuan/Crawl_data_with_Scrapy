I use this every night to help prevent wrinkles & brighten my under eyes. You only need VERY little to use this product. I gave a comparison for reference as to how small the squeeze container is for anyone who is questioning. I only just started this about 10 days ago so I see no real difference yet but again it's only been 10 days and aging takes a while. I'm getting into more skin care & self care so this is more of a luxury item for myself rather than a need.,5,20/04/2023,50931,Ava L.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/6/26/ein7aaAm9GC.jpg
I really like this eye cream. I'm 34 and have been getting more sun lately so have put my skincare into overdrive to battle any aging that it may cause I love this stuff. I have been using it daily for 2.5 weeks and I see a difference in my crows feet. Very happy.,5,15/04/2023,50931,Emma T.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/6/26/un7d3wbvInl.jpg

This is very hydrating yet not sticky nor does it give a greasy look on the delicate skin around the eyes.,5,17/03/2023,50931,Beverly C.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/6/26/2CL86tHq_I.jpg

"After about a week of consistent use, I noticed a visible change. The wrinkles are still there ofcourse, but my skin is more hydrated and shiny, the wrinkles are less visible.

"Right after applying we feel like it made us feel better, looks less puffy. It's thinner than other eye creams we've tried but that makes it easier to apply and we liked that too.",5,22/02/2023,50931,Sarah G.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/6/26/A77EkNrb1j.jpg

"After a month or so of use, I can say that I can see a difference. When I wear it under my concealer there's very few wrinkles visible for my make up to settle into. Leaves my under eyes moisturized and does seem to reduce the look of wrinkles.",4,22/03/2023,50931,Sophia B.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/6/26/fFOphV2hw.jpg
