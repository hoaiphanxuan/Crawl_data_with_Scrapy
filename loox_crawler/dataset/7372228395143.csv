Really works,5,15/04/2023,18524,Michelle L.,review@abera.us,,
"It works. Removed 2 skin tags in the matter of a few weeks. Be careful tho, the reason those marks are so big is be cause the stuff got onto my skin and gave me a chemical burn. I had put too much on the skin tag so when I put the bandaid on, it squished the gel onto my skin. My fault, obviously. But just be super careful please.",5,10/04/2023,18524,Kevin N.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/5/15/YaFHoxCDO.jpg

Just use as directed. Apply once or twice each day on top of previous scab. Stings a little for about 10 minutes. My warts peeled off in about 2-3 days. Leaves a small red scar that eventually disappears. YMMV.,5,20/03/2023,18524,Stephanie P.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/5/15/BVYdwfTn_I.jpg
I've use this on my mother many years ago ago ane it works very well.,5,10/03/2023,18524,Linda C.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/5/15/5eGsdve0x5.jpg
I know this product is for warts but I use it on skin tabs. I'm older and have sun damaged skin around my neck and get larger skin tabs around my collar. This works great after 3or 4 applications. It burns for a minute or two but works great. I found this to have a much longer shelf life than the competitor's bottled product. I highly recommend and will buy again.,5,01/03/2023,18524,Samantha D.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/5/15/49S-LEN8lW.jpg
It does what it is supposed to do.,4,05/04/2023,18524,Jennifer T.,review@abera.us,,
This stuff removed the wart on the side of my face in one day with no problems. Would use again.,4,15/03/2023,18524,Brian D.,review@abera.us,,https://images.loox.io/uploads/2023/5/15/uxXK6uTFIG.jpg
"My ex-boyfriend had a wart on his hand, and now I do to. Bummer. Yep, they spread! After trying a few other products, I gave this a try. Save your money, and if you have a wart, just get this stuff. It's the best. Application is easy, and the gel dries after a few minutes to a bright white haze which clings to the skin even after handwashing for 1-2 days. Some peeling follows, as the wart slowly dies with multiple applications. If needed in the future, I won't buy anything else.",4,25/02/2023,18524,Michael J.,review@abera.us,,
